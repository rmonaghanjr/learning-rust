# learning-rust
I am learning rust a bit more and I will write my thoughts at the end of each day here.

# day 1
source: `src/day1.rs`

input: `inputs/day1.txt`

I feel like turning everything into an iterator for these kinds of problems will eventually bite me in the butt...I have no idea if there is anything wrong performance-wise with doing it this way. I do like the way that it mimics functional programming. Can't wait until I can use some of the more advanced rust features.
